Baremark: A Tiny Markdown Engine
================================
<toc>

**22 September 2024 – Breaking changes.** Where previously `baremark.add(…)`
was used to extend rules, now use `baremark().push([…])`. (*Note the added
brackets!*) – This makes Baremark smaller *and* adds more flexibility! All
Javascript array methods may now be used to work with the ruleset. (For
example, one may now use `baremark().unshift([…])` to add a rule to be executed
first, which wasn’t previously possible.)

*Baremark* is a minimal (but extendable) [Markdown] parser written in
Javascript, originally inspired by Van Tigranyan’s Gist [Landmark], but with
added bugfixes, optimizations, support for labeled links/images, and a little
more [CommonMark] compliance. (Note that Baremark never will be *fully*
CommonMark compliant, as the intent of Baremark is source code brevity above
featurefulness.)

* [README]
* [Source code]
* [Test suite]
* [Github page]

It is currently 1973 bytes in size *before* minification and zipping!


Usage
=====
Baremark can be invoked in two ways.

* `baremark(MARKDOWN)` – Expand `MARKDOWN` and return the resulting HTML. (Most
  of the time, this is the only function you need.)

* `baremark()` – Returns the list of rules used internally by Baremark. This is
  used to extend the Baremark rules (for supporting your own non-standard
  Markdown). See below.

* `baremark.escape(STRING)` – Expands any characters in `STRING` that are
  special in Markdown into HTML `&#…;` entities. This means that further
  processing will not affect `STRING`. For example use, see below.


Extending Baremark
------------------
Baremark’s internals are very simple. It consists of a list of rules, which are
applied, in order, to the inputted Markdown text. Each rule is passed on
*exactly as-is* to the Javascript `replace()` string method. Yet, from this
simplicity come remarkable versatility.

Let’s take an example. The below rule turns `[#text]` into `<a id="text"></a>`,
allowing you to use add fragment URL anchors to your text (so that you to put
`#text` into your URL to scroll to that part of the page). – This rule is added
to the end of the current ruleset using `baremark().push()` (meaning that it
will be applied *after* all the previously existing rules).

```
// Fragment URL anchor: Turns `[#text]` into <a id="text"></a>.
baremark().push([/\[#([^.:\[\]\s]+)\][\t ]*/g, '<a id="$1"></a>'])
```

Below’s is another, more involved, example of a Baremark rule. This one parses
the first paragraph of the Markdown input as metadata if possible. (If the
first paragraph *isn’t* formatted like an email or HTTP header then it is left
untouched, otherwise it’s removed and the metadata is stored in a variable for
later use.) This rule needs to be processed first, before any other rules, and
so it is added using `baremark().unshift()`.

First a small Javascript module called `baremarkHeaders` is created (this acts
as a container for the returned metadata). It consists of an internal scope
(with the private variable `meta` hidden in it), and a Javascript array with an
extra method `get()` that can be used to return the metadata after invoking
`baremark()`.

```
// Baremark rule for reading header style metadata. Processes first paragraph
// as metadata if (and only if) it looks like an email headers (e.g. 'Author:
// <name>'). After `baremark()` call `baremarkHeaders.get()` to get object
// with metadata values.
const baremarkHeaders = (meta => Object.assign([
    /^(\n*)((\w+:.*\n)+)\n+/,
    (_, nl, txt) => {
        meta = {}
        txt.split(/^/m).forEach(x => {
            const [_, name, value] = /^(\w+):\s*(.*)\n/.exec(x)
            meta[name.toLowerCase()] = value
        })
        return nl
    }],
    { get: () => meta })
)()

// Invoking it.
baremark().unshift(baremarkHeaders)        // add rule
const html = baremark(markdown)
const meta = baremarkHeaders.get()         // get metadata
```

Also, multiple rules can be added at the same time:

```
baremark().unshift(
    [/\[#([^.:\[\]\s]+)\][\t ]*/g, '<a id="$1"></a>'],        // hash anchor
    [/\b[a-z]+:\/\/[^ \n<>]*\w/gi,x =>                        // autolink URL
        `<a href="${baremark.escape(x)}">${baremark.escape(x)}</a>`],
)
```

Above we also use the `baremark.escape()` to prevent the autolinked URL from
being further processed by Baremark. This stops Markdown characters (like `_`)
which might occur in the URL from being expanded by later Baremark rules (which
would result in HTML tags being inserted, breaking the link it).

Finally, since rules are passed exactly as-is to the Javascript string method
`replace()`, so the [MDN docs] on the subject is recommended reading.


Common Gotchas when Extending Baremark
--------------------------------------
**Forgetting the `[` and `]` around the rules.** – If you forget the brackets
when adding rules (with `baremark().push([…])` or `baremark().unshift([…])`)
you’ll get a very cryptic error message upon running `baremark(MARKDOWN)`.

```
Uncaught TypeError: r is not iterable
```

**Forgetting the `/g` flag on the regex.** – If you forget this flag, your
regex will only be applied once. This is very seldom the right choice and can
lead to some hand-to-find errors. (Though, for a counterexample, look at the
`baremarkHeaders` extension above.)

**Each regex is applied to the *whole* of the Markdown source.** – Thus, for
inline elements, you need to make *sure* that you allow single newlines to
match inside your Markdown element, but never *two newlines after each other*
(or your element will match across paragraph borders). The rule for `**bold**`,
for example, look like this:

```
[/(\*\*|__)(\n?(.+\n)*?.*?)\1/g,'<b>$2</b>']
```

Notice the `(\n?(.+\n)*?.*?)` part in the middle? That matches, ‘one optional
newline’ (`\n?`), followed by ‘as few as possible, optional, lines that has at
least one non-newline character, and ends in newline’ (`(.+\n)*?`), followed by
‘as few as possible, optional, non-newline characters’ (`.*?`). – That’s a
pretty elaborate way to say that `**…**` shouldn’t match if there are two
newlines next to each other inside it.


Limitations
===========
These limitations might change in the future.

* Any indentation is ignored.

* Only fenced [Code blocks] are supported (not indented ditto).

* [Blockquotes] cannot be nested.

* [Lists] cannot be nested.

* Whitespace at end-of-line is interpreted literally. (The [CommonMark]
  specifies that these should be ignored.)

* Any piece of text separated from the rest of the text by blank lines is
  considered a paragraph (and `<p>…</p>` is placed around it), except if the
  paragraph starts with one of the following paragraph-ending tags (or the
  corresponding end tags): `address`, `article`, `aside`, `blockquote`,
  `details`, `div`, `dl`, `fieldset`, `figcaption`, `figure`, `footer`, `form`,
  `h1…h6`, `header`, `hgroup`, `hr`, `main`, `menu`, `nav`, `noscript`, `ol`,
  `p`, `pre`, `script`, `search`, `section`, `style`, `table`, `ul`. ([MDN: The
  `<p>` Element]).

* Whitespace in not allowed between `](` or `][` in [links and images]. This
  allowed in the [CommonMark] specification, but can lead to weird errors.
  (Baremark allow space inside the brackets though, so your line wrapping
  shouldn’t be too affected.)


[Markdown]: #markdown
Markdown
========
Even though much inspiration is taken from the [CommonMark] specification,
Baremark sometimes go in a slightly different direction (usually for the sake
of brevity). For example, Baremark does not care about indentation at all, nor
does it support autolinks, or nesting of [blockquotes] or [lists].

Some advanced Markdown features (such as tables) are not supported. (Though
extensions can be used to add support.)


[Block Elements]: #block-elements
Block Elements
--------------
Block elements are paragraph-level stuff, like lists, headings and the like.
Most of them are separated from the surrounding blocks by blank lines, though
some of them (like [blockquotes], [lists][bullet] and [label definitions]) do
not require that.


[Paragraph]: #paragraphs
[Paragraphs]: #paragraphs
### Paragraphs

Paragraphs are any text that is surrounded by blank lines, which isn’t
recognized as any other type of block. They are wrapped in a paragraph tag
`<p>...</p>`, and any Markdown contained in the paragraph is also expanded.


[HTML Block]: #html-blocks
[HTML Blocks]: #html-blocks
### HTML Blocks

The only difference between *HTML blocks* and [paragraphs] is that paragraphs
are outputted wrapped in paragraph tags `<p>...</p>`, while HTML blocks are
not. (Markdown is expanded in both paragraphs and HTML blocks.)

If one of the following HTML tags `<...>`, or their corresponding end tags
`</...>` is found at the beginning of a paragraph, it is considered an HTML
block: `address`, `article`, `aside`, `blockquote`, `details`, `div`, `dl`,
`fieldset`, `figcaption`, `figure`, `footer`, `form`, `h1` … `h6`, `header`,
`hgroup`, `hr`, `main`, `menu`, `nav`, `noscript`, `ol`, `p`, `pre`, `script`,
`search`, `section`, `style`, `table` and `ul`. (These are the tags that close
any currently open `<p>` tag. See also: [MDN: The `<p>` Element]).


[Atx Heading]: #-heading-1---heading-6
[Atx Headings]: #-heading-1---heading-6
### `# HEADING 1` … `###### HEADING 6`

This is an atx style heading, it starts with 1–6 `#` on a line of their own.
They must be preceded and followed by a blank line. They are expanded into HTML
tags `<h1>` to `<h6>`.

```
# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

##### Heading 5

###### Heading 6
 
```


[Setext Heading]: #heading-1-heading-2--------
[Setext Headings]: #heading-1-heading-2--------
### `HEADING 1↲==========` `HEADING 2↲---------`

This is a Setext heading, which consist of (one or more lines) of text,
underlined by a line consisting of either `=` or `-` characters. If the
underlining uses `=` the heading expands into `<h1>`, while if the underlining
consists of `-` it expands into `<h2>`. The heading must be preceded by a blank
line, no blank line is required after the underlining.

```
Heading 1
=========
Blabla...

Heading 2
---------
Blabla...
```


[Blockquote]: #-blockquote
[Blockquotes]: #-blockquote
### `> BLOCKQUOTE`


A blockquote is any paragraph where each lines start with `>`. Blockquotes
cannot be nested, but they may contain [lists] and [span elements].

```
> Information is noise, unless it’s
> the information you’re looking for.
```

[Lists]: #lists
### Lists

[Bullet]: #-bullet--bullet---bullet
[Bullets]: #-bullet--bullet---bullet
#### `* BULLET` `+ BULLET` `- BULLET`

A bullet list item is any line that starts with `-`, `+` or `*` followed by a
space. The different bullet characters may be mixed freely within the same
list. If an item is longer than one line, then the subsequent lines must start
with space character. (In this way lists items is the only instance where
indentation matters in Baremark.)

```
- bullet one
+ bullet two, which also happens to be
  a very long multi-line bullet item
* bullet three
```

Bullet lists cannot be nested.


[Numbered]: #1-numbered-2-numbered
#### `1. NUMBERED` `2) NUMBERED`

A numbered list item is any line that starts with a number, followed by `.` or
`)` and then a space. Whether you use `.` or `)` may be mixed freely within the
same list. If an item is longer than one line, then the subsequent lines must
start with space character. (In this way lists items is the only instance where
indentation matters in Baremark.)

Like most Markdown parsers, Baremark ignores the actual numbers. (The outputted
list will always be numbered from 1.)

```
1. numbered item 1
2. numbered item 2
3. numbered item 3
4. numbered item 4
```

Numbered lists cannot be nested.


[Code Block]: #code-block
[Code Blocks]: #code-block
### ` ```↲CODEBLOCK↲``` `

Code blocks start and end with ` ``` ` on a line of its own. (Markdown’s
indented code blocks are not supported by Baremark.) A code block may contain
any kind of preformatted text (not just code).

```
``` 
first line of code
second line of code
etc...
``` 
```


[Dinkus]: #dinkus--------
### Dinkus `-----` `_____` `*****`

A dinkus indicates a break in the text. It is sometimes used to mark the end of
the chapter, or a scene change, or to separate stanzas in poetry. In HTML it
marked by a horizontal ruler by default. (The [CommonMark] spec calls them
“thematic breaks”.)

A dinkus consist of three or more hyphens `-`, underlines `_` or asterisks `*`,
optionally separated by spaces. It must be separated from the surrounding text
with blank lines. Examples:

```
* * *

________________________________________
 
```


[Span Elements]: #span-elements
Span Elements
-------------
*Spans elements* are the markup used for formatting text and adding links
within [block elements]. All of a span element must occur within the same block
(otherwise you’ll see the literal markup characters in the output).

[Span Elements Note]: #span-elements-note
<a id=span-elements-note></a>**NOTE:** The Markdown [bold], [italic] and
[underline] can be nested in, shall we say, *interesting* ways. For example
`*italic **bold-italic* bold**` will generate HTML which is *technically
non-standard,* since the resulting HTML tags `<i>` and `<b>` will be
overlapping (`<i>italic <b>bold-italic</i> bold</b>` → “*italic **bold-italic*
bold**”), and not neatly nested, in the way the HTML standard thinks is
appropriate. In practice, however, I’ve never seen a browser which fails to
render this correctly though.—When in doubt, I suggest you just avoid using
this “feature”. :)


[Backslash Escapes]: #backslash-escapes-x
### Backslash Escapes `\X`

Any ASCII punctuation character may be escaped by preceding it with a
backslash. An escaped character is always interpreted literally. So if you want
an actual asterisk in your text, you can use `\*` to indicate that this is an
asterisk that is not part of a Markdown tag (like for example an `*italic*`
tag). This is [CommonMark] compliant.

The ASCII punctuation characters are:

```
!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\\]^_`{|}~
```

**NOTE:** Unescaped brackets and parentheses are not allowed in the text of
[links and images].


[Links and Images]: #links--images
### Links & Images

Both links and images exists in two types: *[inline][inline links and images]*
and *[labeled][labeled links and images]*. The *[inline form][inline links and
images]* contain the URL *right there,* in the Markdown element itself, while
the *[labeled form][labeled links and images]* and *[shortcut form][shortcut
links and images]* hides away the URL in a separate *[label definition]*,
placed elsewhere in the document, where the (often lengthy) URLs don’t wreak
havoc with the line wrapping of your text. Links are expanded into the HTML tag
`<a href="URL" title="TITLE">TEXT</a>` and images into `<img src="URL"
alt="TEXT" title="TITLE">`. (Baremark only supports `TITLE` for [labeled links
and images].)


[Inline Links and Images]: #inline-links-texturl--images-texturl
#### Inline Links `[TEXT](URL)` & Images `![TEXT](URL)`

The Markdown for inline links and images look the same, except that a leading
leading exclamation point `!` is added for the image form.

**NOTE:** `TEXT` may not contain unescaped brackets `[]` or parentheses `()`.
Put a backslash in front of these characters if you need them.

* **Link** `TEXT` may contain Markdown [span elements] (including images, but
  not links).
* **Image** `TEXT` is a literal string. It is used for the `alt` attribute of
  the outputted `<img>` tag, and browsers use it as a replacement for the image
  itself (if it fails to load, or if text is read aloud, rather than
  displayed). It should contain a brief description of the image (avoiding
  phrasings like “Picture of …”).

`URL` given may contain any valid URL. (You can use relative paths, URL
fragments, or other protocols, like `mailto:` etc.) For images the URL should
point to a valid image. This value is not further expanded (all characters,
even backslash ` \ `, are interpreted literally).

```
Links:
[Example link](http://example.com/)
[Link with relative path](..)
[Link with fragment URL](#top)

Image:
![Logo](logo.svg)

Linked image:
[![About us](logo.png)](../about.html)
```


[Labeled Links and Images]: #labeled-links-textlabel--images-textlabel
#### Labeled Links `[TEXT][LABEL]` & Images `![TEXT][LABEL]`

It is often more convenient to use the labeled form of links and images, since
this form allow you to move the (often very long) URLs out of the flow of the
text, so as interfere reading, or mess up line wrapping.

**NOTE:** `TEXT` and `LABEL` may not contain unescaped brackets `[]` or
parentheses `()`. Put a backslash in front of these characters if you need
them.

* **Link** `TEXT` may contain Markdown [span elements] (including images, but
  not links).
* **Image** `TEXT` is a literal string. It is used for the `alt` attribute of
  the outputted `<img>` tag, and browsers use it as a replacement for the image
  itself (if it fails to load, or if text is read aloud, rather than
  displayed). It should contain a brief description of the image (avoiding
  phrasings like “Picture of …”).

`LABEL` names a [label definition] which contains the link URL (and optionally
title) of the link. `LABEL` is case insensitive and whitespace is normalized
(so that a link label may be word wrapped without causing trouble).

If `LABEL` is not defined in the document, then the link will not be expanded,
but remain as-is in the output. Optionally, `LABEL` may be left empty (or
dropped altogether), see [shortcut links and images].

```
Links:
[Example link][example]
[Link with relative path][up]
[Link with fragment URL][top]

Image:
![Logotype][logo]

Linked image:
[![About us][logo]][about]

[about]: ../about.html (About Page)
[example]: http://example.com/ (An Example Page)
[logo]: baremark.svg (Our Logo)
[top]: #top
[up]: .. (Go up one page)
```


[Shortcut links and images]: #shortcut-links-text--images-text
#### Shortcut Links `[TEXT]` & Images `![TEXT]`

When writing [labeled links and images], the `[LABEL]` part at the end of the
link/image element can be left empty, `[TEXT][]` or `![TEXT][]`, or dropped
completely, `[TEXT]` or `![TEXT]`. In these cases `TEXT` will be used as both
link/image text *and* as `LABEL`.

```
Links:
[About][] page.
[About] page.

Images:
![Logo][]
![Logo]

[about]: ../about.html (About Page)
[logo]: baremark.svg (Our Logo)
```

`TEXT` is used as-is for the link (or image) text, but when looking up the link
URL it is normalized in the same way as `LABEL` (in [labeled links and
images]).—This means that, in the above example, `[About]` and `![Logo]` will
be capitalized in the output, while still using the URL and title defined in
the lower case [label definitions] `[about]: …` and `[logo]: …`.


[label definition]: #label-definitions-label-url-title
[label definitions]: #label-definitions-label-url-title
#### Label Definitions `[LABEL]: URL (TITLE)`

A label definition associates a `LABEL` with a `URL` and (optionally) a
`TITLE`. The label definitions themselves do not show up in the outputted HTML,
but they are used when expanding [labeled links and images]. Label definitions
can be placed anywhere in the document, but are usually placed either after the
paragraph where they are used, or at the end of the document.

A *label definition* are not required to be surrounded by blank lines, but its
`[LABEL]:` part must be the first thing on the line (without indentation).
Thereafter the URL is specified either in angle brackets `<URL>` or without
`URL`. Finally, the optional `TITLE` may be given either in single quotes
`'TITLE'`, double quotes `"TITLE"` or parentheses `(TITLE)`. They can look like
this:

```
[about]: about.html
[up]: .. (Go up one page)
[example]: http://example.com/ (An Example Page)
[logo page]: <../logo.html> "The History of Our Logo"
[ch5]: #chapter-5 'About Ancient Anthologies'
```

`LABEL` cannot contain brackets `[]` or parentheses `()` unless they are
[escaped by backslashes][backslash escapes]. The value is case insensitive, and
whitespace normalized (so that it may be word wrapped without causing trouble).

`URL` can be written either plainly, or bracketed by bigger than/less than
`<>`.

`TITLE` (which is optional) may be surrounded with either parentheses `(…)`,
double quotes `"…"` or single quotes `'…'`. `TITLE` is a literal string (any
Markdown inside it is not expanded), since this is outputted as an HTML
attribute value. This value is typically used by browsers as a hover text for
the link or image.


[italic]: #italic-italic
### `_ITALIC_` `*ITALIC*`

Asterisks `*` or underlines `_` are used to mark *italic text.* These are
expanded into HTML tags `<i>...</i>`. (See also [Note][Span Elements Note],
under “[Span Elements]”, regarding nesting of [bold], [italic] and
[underline].)

```
_italic_ or *italic*
```


[bold]: #bold-bold
### `__BOLD__` `**BOLD**`

Double asterisks `**` or underlines `__` are used to mark **bold text**. These
are expanded into HTML tags `<b>...</b>`. (See also [Note][Span Elements Note],
under “[Span Elements]”, regarding nesting of [bold], [italic] and
[underline].)

```
__bold__ or **bold**
```


[underline]: #underline-extended
### `___UNDERLINE___` (Extended)

Triple underlines `___` (but not asterisks) are used to mark ___underlined
text___. These are expanded into HTML tags `<u>…</u>`. (See also [Note][Span
Elements Note], under “[Span Elements]”, regarding nesting of [bold], [italic]
and [underline].)

```
___UNDERLINE___
```


[strikethrough]: #strikethrough-extended
### `~~STRIKETHROUGH~~` (Extended)

Double tildes `~~` is used to mark ~~strikethrough text~~. These are expanded
into HTML tags `<s>...</s>`.

```
~~STRIKETHROUGH~~
```

[quote]: #quote-extended
### `:"QUOTE":` (Extended)

Colons `:` and straight quotes `"` are used to mark :"quoted text":. These are
expanded into HTML tags `<q>...</q>`.

```
:"QUOTE":
```

**NOTE:** The quotes produced by most (all?) browsers by the HTML `<q>` tag
cannot be copied and pasted, so I tend to stay away from using this Markdown
element.


[code]: #code--code-
### `` `CODE` `` ``` `` CODE `` ```

Backticks `` ` `` are used to mark `code`. `CODE` is literal string (Markdown
inside it is not further processed, and HTML is escaped so that it shows up as
text in the browser) before being wrapped in the HTML `<tt>...</tt>`.
[Backslash escapes] cannot be used in `CODE` (they will simply show up as
backslashes in the output).

Any number of backticks may be used to start the tag, and the same number
number of backticks is used to terminate it. If `CODE` both starts and ends
with space, then exactly one space is stripped off of either end. All of which
means, that to, for example, write a singe backtick as `CODE`, you can use ```
`` ` `` ```.

```
`CODE`
```


History
=======
Baremark was originally based on based on VanTigranyan’s Gist [Landmark] (which
is 2060 bytes in size) but it adds several features (such as labeled links &
images) and fixes some bugs (see below).

It was shortened by:

* Regexes are expanded by preprocessing (so that they may be written even
  shorter).
* Tabs for indentation.
* Shortening all variable names to single letter.
* Using fat arrow functions (`=>`).
* Use of `.reduce()` instead of `for` loops.
* Rules is a list-of-lists (instead of a list of objects).
* Single letter groups in regexes changed to character classes (e.g. `(-|*)` to
  `[-*]`).
* Using Javascript template strings (`` `…` ``).
* Not allowing space before `#`, `---` and `===` in headings, or before/after
  `` ``` ``.
* Replaced unnecessary `.*?` with `.*` (greediness is fine if anchored by `\n`,
  since `.` won’t match newlines).
* Use HTML `<b>` instead of `<strong>` and `<i>` instead of `<em>`.
* Removing unneccesary spaces in source.
* `escape()` rewritten.

Baremark vs. Landmark
---------------------
**Added Features:**
* Exports `escape()` method (for use in extensions).
* More [CommonMark] compatible [dinkus] (consisting 3 or more underscores `_`,
  hyphens `-` or asterisks `*` [optionally separated by spaces] where Landmark
  required 5 or more asterisks `*` [with no spaces between]).
* Support for [backslash escapes] `\X` (CommonMark).
* Support for [labeled links and images] `[TEXT][LABEL]` `![TEXT][LABEL]`
  (CommonMark).
* Support for [shortcut links and images] `[TEXT]` `![TEXT]` (CommonMark).

**Bugfixes:**
* Fixes atx style headings (`# heading` … `###### heading`).
* Bold, italics and inline code may span newlines (but not empty lines).
* Bullet lists now require space after `*` or `-` (avoids confusion with
  italics).
* Blockquotes may contain lists.
* Blank line in lists, or between lines with leading `>` starts new list or
  blockquote.
